Jonny is a young boy with a severe height disadvantage. Although he is very
short, he loves to play basketball. Jonny plays basketball with his best
friends every week. His team consists of a couple other students and his best
friend, Tom. Tom is the opposite of Jonny - he is very tall. Jonny is much
better at basketball than his best friend, so naturally, they are a perfect
fit.

The basketball season had ended at their school, but that didn't stop Jonny
and Tom from getting a few games in when they could. The pair met at Jonny's after school 
and then headed towards the courts at a nearby park  where a few of their other teammates 
would be waiting for them. Both Jonny and Tom were looking forward to that afternoon's
pick up games. The sun was out, homework wasn't due for a couple of days, and they had
been getting really good at their lay ups recently. Today would be a good day.

Both of them started playing as usual. Johny was probably the best among them. 
They all were appreciating Johny's skills. However, this time TOm got jealous. He got jealous and started playing foul. While doing so, he pushed Jonny by mistake and because of the momentum of his body, Jonny had a great fall. He wasnt able to get up. 

Tom instantly realized what he had done. He let his ego get ahead of what truly matter - friendship. Tom and the other teammates helped Jonny up and let him rest. Tom stayed with Jonny while the others practiced. The two made up and decided that friendship is what will win them the championship. The team reconvened and they all agreed.

The team kept friendship above all else and were able to take home the trophy. Jonny and Tom still play basketball to this day.
