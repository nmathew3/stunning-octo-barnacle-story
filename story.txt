Jonny is a young boy with a severe height disadvantage. Although he is very
short, he loves to play basketball. Jonny plays basketball with his best
friends every week. His team consists of a couple other students and his best
friend, Tom. Tom is the opposite of Jonny - he is very tall. Jonny is much
better at basketball than his best friend, so naturally, they are a perfect
fit.
